# VulnerabilityRemediation

## What is this?

I have to remediate vulnerabilities for my day job. The industry standard nessus / tenable vulnerability IDs are as good as place as any to catalog my fixes. If these are useful to you, enjoy! 

Tenable is like a big task list (well, not so big if you have these resources available). Its kinda fun to take a vulnerability to sort out, script, and fix, and thats what I've done here.
