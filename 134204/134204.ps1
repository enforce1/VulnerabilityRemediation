# Synopsis
# The remote host has a web browser installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.
# Description
# The version of Internet Explorer installed on the remote host is missing Cumulative Security Update 3125869 and/or a Registry key to prevent the host against CVE-2015-6161. It is, therefore, affected by Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 through 11 and Microsoft Edge allow remote attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted web site, aka 'Microsoft Browser ASLR Bypass'.
# An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this issue by convincing a user to visit a specially craftedwebsite, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
# An specific Fix to Run from Microsoft or a registry value must be added to enable the fix for CVE-2015-6161.
# Solution
# Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows Vista, 2008, 7, 2008 R2, 8, RT, 2012, 8.1, RT 8.1, 2012 R2, and 10.
# Refer to KB3125869 for additional information.

# Figures out what architecture we are running on. No accomodation for ARM (since I don't own any!)
