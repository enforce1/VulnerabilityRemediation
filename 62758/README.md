# 62758 - Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) and XML Core Services Unsupported

## Fix Description

Search the registry for anything called MSXML and return the DisplayName and Uninstall String. Since this application might be in use by something on the server, its best to tread carefully, set your snapshots, etc. Thankfully in my use-case, the MSXML XML parser was not in use, so the best / easiest / cleanest way to remediate the issue was the uninstall. This powershell script was run through Altiris, but I'm sure any deployment solution would work fine.

## Vulnerability Description

https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/62758 (copied below for convenience)

### Synopsis
The remote Windows host contains unsupported XML parsers.
### Description
The remote host contains one or more unsupported versions of the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) or XML Core Services.

Lack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor. As a result, it is likely to contain security vulnerabilities.

Note that support for MSXML 3.0 and 6.0 is based on the support policy of the operating system on which it is installed. Support for MSXML 5.0 is based on the Microsoft Office lifecycle policy.
### Solution
Upgrade the software packages responsible for the unsupported DLL versions or upgrade to a supported version of Windows (Vista / 2008 or later). Alternatively, uninstall the outdated MSXML or XML Core Services.
